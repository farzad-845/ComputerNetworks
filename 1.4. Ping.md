ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It is available for virtually all operating systems that have networking capability, including most embedded network administration software.

Ping measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. The name comes from active sonar terminology that sends a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water.

Ping operates by means of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. Pinging involves sending an ICMP echo request to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply. The program reports errors, packet loss, and a statistical summary of the results, typically including the minimum, maximum, the mean round-trip times, and standard deviation of the mean.

### Message Format 
The echo request (PING) is an [[1.3. ICMP Header (8 Bytes)]] message.

> The Header of the request is the raw packet with the **protocol = 1** [[1.2. Ip_datagram#^12853f]]


```c
# Echo Request
Type = 8 (IPv4)
Code = 0
Checksum
Identifier
Sequence Number
Payload
```

The Identifier and Sequence Number can be used by the client to match the reply with the request that caused the reply. In practice, most Linux systems use a unique identifier for every ping process, and sequence number is an increasing number within that process.

---
The _echo reply_ is an ICMP message generated in response to an echo request; it is mandatory for all hosts and must include the exact payload received in the request.

```c
# Reply Request
Type = 0 (IPv4)
Code = 0
Checksum
Identifier
Sequence Number
Payload
```

The _identifier_ and _sequence number_ can be used by the client to associate each echo request with its reply.
