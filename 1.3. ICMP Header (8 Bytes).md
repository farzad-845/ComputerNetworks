The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address, for example, an error is indicated when a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.[2] ICMP differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility) "Ping (networking utility)") and [traceroute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute "Traceroute")).

IP Fields:

Addresses
   The address of the source in a information request message will be the destination of the information reply message.  To form a information reply message, the source and destination addresses are simply reversed, the type code changed to 16, and the checksum recomputed.

Type
	**Summary of Message Types**
```c
0   Echo Reply
3   Destination Unreachable
4   Source Quench
5   Redirect
8   Echo
11  Time Exceeded
12  Parameter Problem
13  Timestamp
14  Timestamp Reply
15  Information Request
16  Information Reply
```

Code
	 0

Checksum
   The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's complement sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP Type. For computing the checksum , the checksum field should be zero. This checksum may be replaced in the future.

Identifier
	If code = 0, an identifier to aid in matching request and replies, may be zero.

Sequence Number
	If code = 0, a sequence number to aid in matching request and replies, may be zero.


Description
   This message may be sent with the source network in the IP header source and destination address fields zero (which means "this" network).  The replying IP module should send the reply with the addresses fully specified.  This message is a way for a host to find out the number of the network it is on.
   
   The identifier and sequence number may be used by the echo sender to aid in matching the replies with the requests.  For example, the identifier might be used like a port in TCP or UDP to identify a session, and the sequence number might be incremented on each request sent.  The destination returns these same values in the reply.

> Code 0 may be received from a gateway or a host.
