### fcntl - manipulate file descriptor
```c
#include <fcntl.h>
int fcntl(int _fd_, int _cmd_, ... /*** _arg_ ***/ );
```

**fcntl**() performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor _fd_.  The operation is determined by _cmd_.

---
### sigemptyset â€” initialize and empty a signal set

```c
#include <signal.h>

int sigemptyset(sigset_t *_set_);
```
---
### sigaddset

```c
#include <signal.h>

int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signo);
```
The _sigaddset()_ function adds the individual signal specified by the _signo_ to the signal set pointed to by _set_.

----
## **sigprocmask**() 
is used to fetch and/or change the signal mask of the calling thread.  The signal mask is the set of signals whose delivery is currently blocked for the caller

```c
#include <signal.h>

/* Prototype for the glibc wrapper function */
int sigprocmask(int _how_, const sigset_t *restrict _set_, sigset_t *restrict _oldset_);
```

How Parameter:
1. **SIG_BLOCK** The set of blocked signals is the union of the current set and the _set_ argument.
2. **SIG_UNBLOCK** The signals in _set_ are removed from the current set of blocked signals.  It is permissible to attempt to unblock a signal which is not blocked.
3. **SIG_SETMASK** The set of blocked signals is set to the argument _set_.
