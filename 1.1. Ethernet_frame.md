> We are in level two, so we need 64 ~ 1522 Bytes.

-   **Destination Address –** This is a 6-Byte field that contains the MAC address of the machine for which data is destined.

-   **Source Address –** This is a 6-Byte field that contains the MAC address of the source machine. As Source Address is always an individual address (Unicast), the least significant bit of the first byte is always 0.

-  **EtherType** is a 2 Byte field, It is used to indicate which [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") is [encapsulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking) "Encapsulation (networking)") in the payload of the frame and is used at the receiving end by the [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer") to determine how the payload is processed. The same field is also used to indicate the size of some Ethernet frames.

-   **Data –** This is the place where actual data is inserted, also known as **Payload**. Both IP header and data will be inserted here if Internet Protocol is used over Ethernet. The maximum data present may be as long as 1500 Bytes. In case data length is less than minimum length i.e. 46 bytes, then padding 0’s is added to meet the minimum possible length.
