ARP Packet Fields:
```c
HT      Hardware Type (*)
PT      Protocol Type (*)
HAL     Hardware Address Length (*)
PAL     Protocol Address Length (uses new value 12)
OP      Operation Code (uses experimental value OP_EXP1=24)
S_HA    Sender Hardware Address (*)
S_L32   Sender L32  (* same as Sender IPv4 address for ARP)
S_NID   Sender Node Identifier (8 bytes)
T_HA    Target Hardware Address (*)
T_L32   Target L32  (* same as Target IPv4 address for ARP)
T_NID   Target Node Identifier (8 bytes)
```


```
Ethernet transmission layer (not necessarily accessible tothe user):
        48.bit: Ethernet address of destination
        48.bit: Ethernet address of sender
        16.bit: Protocol type = ether_type$ADDRESS_RESOLUTION
    Ethernet packet data:
        16.bit: (ar$hrd) Hardware address space (e.g., Ethernet, Packet Radio Net.)
        16.bit: (ar$pro) Protocol address space.  For Ethernet hardware, this is from the set of type fields ether_typ$<protocol>.
         8.bit: (ar$hln) byte length of each hardware address
         8.bit: (ar$pln) byte length of each protocol address
        16.bit: (ar$op)  opcode (ares_op$REQUEST | ares_op$REPLY)
        nbytes: (ar$sha) Hardware address of sender of this packet, n from the ar$hln field.
        mbytes: (ar$spa) Protocol address of sender of this packet, m from the ar$pln field.
        nbytes: (ar$tha) Hardware address of target of this packet (if known).
        mbytes: (ar$tpa) Protocol address of target.
```

Hardware type (HT)
	This field specifies the network link protocol type. Example: Ethernet is 1.

Protocol type (PT)
	This field specifies the internetwork protocol for which the ARP request is intended. For IPv4, this has the value 0x0800. The permitted PTYPE values share a numbering space with those for [EtherType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherType "EtherType")

Hardware length (HAL)
	Length (in [octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing) "Octet (computing)")) of a hardware address. Ethernet address length is 6.

Protocol length (PAL)
	Length (in octets) of internetwork addresses. The internetwork protocol is specified in PTYPE. Example: IPv4 address length is 4.

Operation (OP)
	Specifies the operation that the sender is performing: 1 for request, 2 for reply.

Sender hardware address (S_HA)
	Media address of the sender. In an ARP request this field is used to indicate the address of the host sending the request. In an ARP reply this field is used to indicate the address of the host that the request was looking for.

Sender protocol address (S_L32)
	Internetwork address of the sender.

Target hardware address (T_HA)
	Media address of the intended receiver. In an ARP request this field is ignored. In an ARP reply this field is used to indicate the address of the host that originated the ARP request.

Target protocol address (T_L32)
	Internetwork address of the intended receiver.

> **The [EtherType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherType "EtherType") for ARP is 0x0806.**
