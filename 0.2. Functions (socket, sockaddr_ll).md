## Socket

**socket - create an endpoint for communication**

**socket**() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor that refers to that endpoint.  The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.


```
#include <sys/socket.h>

int socket(int _domain_, int _type_, int _protocol_);
```

### DOMAIN
The _domain_ argument specifies a communication domain; this selects the protocol family which will be used for communication. These families are defined in _<sys/socket.h>_.

### TYPE
The socket has the indicated _type_, which specifies the communication semantics.  Currently defined types are:

SOCK_STREAM
    Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be supported.
    
SOCK_DGRAM
	Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed maximum length).

SOCK_SEQPACKET
    Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer is required to read an entire packetwith each input system call.

SOCK_RAW
	Provides raw network protocol access.

SOCK_RDM
	Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee ordering.

SOCK_PACKET
	Obsolete and should not be used in new programs; see  [packet(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html).

> SOCK_RAW is important

### PROTOCOL
The _protocol_ specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket.
List protocols are [here](https://github.com/spotify/linux/blob/master/include/linux/if_ether.h), (ex: 0x0800 -> Internet Protocol packet & 0x0806 -> ARP)

> When protocol is set to **htons(ETH_P_ALL)**, then all protocols are received.  All incoming packets of that protocol type will be passed to the packet socket before they are passed  to the protocols implemented in the kernel.

**RETURN VALUE**
On success, a file descriptor for the new socket is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and _[errno](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html)_ is set to indicate the error.

## Sockaddr_ll

packet - packet interface on device level

```
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <linux/if_packet.h>
#include <net/ethernet.h>

// Usage -> create socket with AF_PACKET
packet_socket = socket(AF_PACKET, int _socket_type_, int _protocol_);
```

Packet sockets are used to receive or send raw packets at the device driver (OSI Layer 2) level.  They allow the user to implement protocol modules in user space on top of the physical layer.

The _sockaddr_ll_ structure is a device-independent physical-layer address.

```
struct sockaddr_ll {
    unsigned short sll_family;   /* Always AF_PACKET */
    unsigned short sll_protocol; /* Physical-layer protocol */
    int            sll_ifindex;  /* Interface number */
    unsigned short sll_hatype;   /* ARP hardware type */
    unsigned char  sll_pkttype;  /* Packet type */
    unsigned char  sll_halen;    /* Length of address */
	unsigned char  sll_addr[8];  /* Physical-layer address */
};
```

The fields of this structure are as follows:
- _sll_protocol_ is the standard ethernet protocol type in network byte order as defined in the _<linux/if_ether.h>_ include file. It defaults to the socket's protocol.

-  _sll_ifindex_ is the interface index of the interface (see [netdevice(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netdevice.7.html)); 0 matches any interface (only permitted for binding).  _sll_hatype_ is an ARP type as defined in the _<linux/if_arp.h>_ include file.

-  _sll_pkttype_ contains the packet type.  Valid types are **PACKET_HOST** for a packet addressed to the local host, **PACKET_BROADCAST** for a physical-layer broadcast packet, **PACKET_MULTICAST** for a packet sent to a physical-layer multicast address, **PACKET_OTHERHOST** for a packet to some other host that has been caught by a device driver in promiscuous mode, and **PACKET_OUTGOING** for a packet originating from the local host that is looped back to a packet socket.  These types make sense only for receiving.

-  _sll_addr_ and _sll_halen_ contain the physical-layer (e.g., IEEE  802.3) address and its length.  The exact interpretation depends on the device.

*Important Note:*

> When you send packets, it is enough to specify _sll_family_, _sll_addr_, _sll_halen_, _sll_ifindex_, and _sll_protocol_.  The other fields should be 0.  _sll_hatype_ and _sll_pkttype_ are set on received packets for your information.
