## sendTo

send a message from a socket
    
```
#include<sys/socket.h>

sendto(int socket, const void *buffer, size_t length, int flags, const struct sockaddr *dest_addr, socklen_t dest_len);
```

**RETURN VALUES**
Upon successful completion, the number of bytes which were sent is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

### Recvfrom

recvfrom — receive a message from a socket
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>

ssize_t recvfrom(int _socket_, void *restrict _buffer_, size_t _length_, int _flags_, struct sockaddr *restrict _address_, socklen_t *restrict _address_len_);
```

The _recvfrom_() function shall receive a message from a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is normally  used with connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the application to retrieve the source address of received data.

The _recvfrom_() function shall return the length of the message written to the buffer pointed to by the _buffer_ argument. For message-based sockets, such as SOCK_RAW, SOCK_DGRAM, and  SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a single operation. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the _flags_ argument, the excess bytes shall be discarded.

**RETURN VALUE**
Upon successful completion, _recvfrom_() shall return the length of the message in bytes. If no messages are available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, _recvfrom_() shall return 0. Otherwise, the function shall return -1 and set _[errno](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html)_ to indicate the error.
