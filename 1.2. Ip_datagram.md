Note that each tick mark represents one bit position.

  Version:  4 bits
	  The Version field indicates the format of the internet header.  This document describes version 4.

  IHL:  4 bits
	Internet Header Length is the length of the internet header in 32 bit words, and thus points to the beginning of the data.  Note that the minimum value for a correct header is 5.

Type of Service:  8 bits
	The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract parameters of the quality of service desired.  These parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters when transmitting a datagram through a particular network.  Several networks offer service precedence, which somehow treats high precedence traffic as more important than other traffic (generally by accepting only traffic above a certain precedence at time of high load).  The major choice is a three way tradeoff between low-delay, high-reliability, and high-throughput.

```c
Bits 0-2:  Precedence.
Bit    3:  0 = Normal Delay,      1 = Low Delay.
Bits   4:  0 = Normal Throughput, 1 = High Throughput.
Bits   5:  0 = Normal Relibility, 1 = High Relibility.
Bit  6-7:  Reserved for Future Use.

   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|                 |     |     |     |     |     |
|   PRECEDENCE    |  D  |  T  |  R  |  0  |  0  |
|                 |     |     |     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Precedence
111 - Network Control
110 - Internetwork Control
101 - CRITIC/ECP
100 - Flash Override
011 - Flash
010 - Immediate
001 - Priority
000 - Routine
```

The use of the Delay, Throughput, and Reliability indications may increase the cost (in some sense) of the service.  In many networks better performance for one of these parameters is coupled with worse performance on another.  Except for very unusual cases at most two of these three indications should be set.

The type of service is used to specify the treatment of the datagram during its transmission through the internet system.  Example mappings of the internet type of service to the actual service provided on networks such as AUTODIN II, ARPANET, SATNET, and PRNET is given in "Service Mappings" [[8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791#ref-8 ""Service Mappings,"")].

The Network Control precedence designation is intended to be used within a network only.  The actual use and control of that designation is up to each network. The Internetwork Control designation is intended for use by gateway control originators only. If the actual use of these precedence designations is of concern to a particular network, it is the responsibility of that network to control the access to, and use of, those precedence designations.

Total Length:  16 bits
	Total Length is the length of the datagram, measured in octets, including internet header and data.  This field allows the length of a datagram to be up to 65,535 octets.  Such long datagrams are impractical for most hosts and networks.  All hosts must be prepared to accept datagrams of up to 576 octets (whether they arrive whole or in fragments).  It is recommended that hosts only send datagrams larger than 576 octets if they have assurance that the destination is prepared to accept the larger datagrams.

The number 576 is selected to allow a reasonable sized data block to be transmitted in addition to the required header information.  For example, this size allows a data block of 512 octets plus 64 header octets to fit in a datagram.  The maximal internet header is 60 octets, and a typical internet header is 20 octets, allowing a margin for headers of higher level protocols.

Identification:  16 bits
	An identifying value assigned by the sender to aid in assembling the fragments of a datagram.

Flags:  3 bits
	Various Control Flags.

```c
Bit 0: reserved, must be zero
Bit 1: (DF) 0 = May Fragment,  1 = Don't Fragment.
Bit 2: (MF) 0 = Last Fragment, 1 = More Fragments.

 0   1   2
+---+---+---+
|   | D | M |
| 0 | F | F |
+---+---+---+
```

Fragment Offset:  13 bits
	This field indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs. The fragment offset is measured in units of 8 octets (64 bits).  The first fragment has offset zero.

Time to Live:  8 bits
	Time to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism which limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded or revalidated. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is commonly used to improve the performance and manage the caching of data. 

 > 64 can be a good value.

Protocol:  8 bits
	This field indicates the next level protocol used in the data portion of the internet datagram.  The values for various protocols are specified in "Assigned Numbers" [9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791#ref-9 ""Assigned Numbers,"").

Header Checksum:  16 bits
	A checksum on the header only.  Since some header fields change (e.g., time to live), this is recomputed and verified at each point that the internet header is processed.
	
  The checksum algorithm is:
  The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header.  For purposes of computing the checksum, the value of the checksum field is zero.

```c
unsigned short checksum (void * b, int s){
	int i;
	unsigned short * p;
	unsigned int tot=0;
	 
	p = (unsigned short *) b;
	
	for (i=0; i<s/2; i++){
		tot +=ntohs(p[i]);
		if ( tot & 0x10000) tot = (tot&0xFFFF) + 1;
	}
	
	if ( i*2 != s ){
		tot+=ntohs(p[i])&0xFF00;
		if ( tot & 0x10000) tot = (tot&0xFFFF) + 1;
	}
	
	return  (0xFFFF-(unsigned short)tot);
}
```
  
  his is a simple to compute checksum and experimental evidence indicates it is adequate, but it is provisional and may be replaced by a CRC procedure, depending on further experience.
